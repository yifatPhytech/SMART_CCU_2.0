            time app gets end time and calc duration from it.
            same for both valves & pumps.
            U.6.24.24

05/08/2024  1. change protocol with CBU when CBU initiates message to CCU: first - CBU turns on RTS 2nd- when CCU availeable - it sends general msg to CBU
            3rd - CBU send what it wants (alert\ config parameters\get param...) 4th - CCU sends response to the CBU request.  
            2. when CCU opens pump - it always sends the duration of the current irrigation, so CBU will know when it should close even if something went wrong. 
            because of this - do not switch off pumps on reset.     
            3. when gets task of update vcu list - turn on flag g_bSendList to send list back to server.
            4. use same bootloader adress to atmel FOTA & EZR FOTA.    
            5. add energy managment: 1> if 10 minutes in a row there was no power from MCU - send alert 101. later send this alert once in an our.

            3. finish CBU alert protocol
            4. do not close pump if status doesnt fit
            U.8.24.24
